This has implications for a wide variety of industries, from IT and software organizations that can benefit from the instantaneous, largely correct code generated by AI models to organizations in need of marketing copy. In short, any organization that needs to produce clear written materials potentially stands to benefit. Organizations can also use generative AI to create more technical materials, such as higher-resolution versions of medical images.

Companies looking to put generative AI to work have the option to either use generative AI out of the box or fine-tune them to perform a specific task.

      "The outputs generative AI models produce may often sound extremely convincing. This is by design. But sometimes the information they generate is just plain wrong. Worse, sometimes it‚Äôs biased (because it‚Äôs built on the gender, racial, and myriad other biases of the internet and society more generally) and can be manipulated to enable unethical or criminal activity. For example, ChatGPT won‚Äôt give you instructions on how to hotwire a car, but if you say you need to hotwire a car to save a baby, the algorithm is happy to comply. Organizations that rely on generative AI models should reckon with reputational and legal risks involved in unintentionally publishing biased, offensive, or copyrighted content.\n",
      "These risks can be mitigated, however, in a few ways. For one, it‚Äôs crucial to carefully select the initial data used to train these models to avoid including toxic or biased content. Next, rather than employing an off-the-shelf generative AI model, organizations could consider using smaller, specialized models. Organizations with more resources could also customize a general model based on their own data to fit their needs and minimize biases. Organizations should also keep a human in the loop (that is, to make sure a real human checks the output of a generative AI model before it is published or used) and avoid using generative AI models for critical decisions, such as those involving significant resources or human welfare.\n",

Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation.\\nA green apple split into 3 parts on a gray background. Half of the apple is made out of a digital blue wireframe mesh.\\n(5 pages)\\nIn the months and years\\nsince ChatGPT burst on the scene in November 2022, generative AI (gen AI) has come a long way. Every month sees the launch of new tools, rules, or iterative technological advancements. While many have reacted to ChatGPT (and AI and machine learning more broadly) with fear, machine learning clearly has the potential for good. In the years since its wide deployment, machine learning has demonstrated impact in a number of industries, accomplishing things like\\nmedical imaging analysis\\nand high-resolution weather forecasts. A 2022 McKinsey survey shows that AI adoption has\\nmore than doubled\\nover the past five years, and investment in AI is increasing apace. It‚Äôs clear that generative AI tools like ChatGPT (the GPT stands for generative pretrained transformer) and image generator DALL-E (its name a mashup of the surrealist artist Salvador Dal√≠ and the lovable Pixar robot WALL-E) have the potential to change how a range of jobs are performed. The full scope of that impact, though, is still unknown‚Äîas are the risks.\\nGet to know and directly engage with McKinsey\\'s senior experts on generative AI\\nAamer Baig\\nis a senior partner in McKinsey‚Äôs Chicago office;\\nLareina Yee\\nis a senior partner in the Bay Area office; and senior partners\\nAlex Singla\\nand\\nAlexander Sukharevsky\\n, global leaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, are based in the Chicago and London\\xa0offices, respectively.\\nStill, organizations of all stripes have raced to incorporate gen AI tools into their business models, looking to capture a piece of a sizable prize. McKinsey research indicates that gen AI applications stand to add\\nup to $4.4 trillion\\nto the global economy‚Äîannually. Indeed, it seems possible that within the next three years, anything in the technology, media, and telecommunications space not connected to AI will be considered\\nobsolete or ineffective\\n.\\nBut before all that value can be raked in, we need to get a few things straight: What is gen AI, how was it developed, and what does it mean for people and organizations? Read on to get the download.\\nTo stay up to date on this critical topic, sign up for email alerts on ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù\\nhere\\n.\\nLearn more about\\nQuantumBlack\\n, AI by McKinsey.\\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?\\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\\nQuantumBlack,\\nMcKinsey‚Äôs AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world‚Äôs most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\\nArtificial intelligence\\nis pretty much just what it sounds like‚Äîthe practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. You‚Äôve probably interacted with AI even if you don‚Äôt realize it‚Äîvoice assistants like Siri and Alexa are founded on AI technology, as are customer service chatbots that pop up to help you navigate websites.\\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. Through machine learning, practitioners develop artificial intelligence through models that can ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from data patterns without human direction. The unmanageably huge volume and complexity of data (unmanageable by humans, anyway) that is now being generated has\\nincreased machine learning‚Äôs potential\\n, as well as the need for it.\\nWhat are the main types of machine learning models?\\nMachine learning is founded on a number of building blocks, starting with\\nclassical statistical techniques\\ndeveloped between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, the pioneers of computing‚Äîincluding theoretical mathematician Alan Turing‚Äîbegan working on the basic techniques for machine learning. But these techniques were limited to laboratories until the late 1970s, when scientists first developed computers powerful enough to mount them.\\nUntil recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe and classify patterns in content. For example, a classic machine learning problem is to start with an image or several images of, say, adorable cats. The program would then identify patterns among the images, and then scrutinize random images for ones that would match the adorable cat pattern. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Rather than simply\\nperceive\\nand\\nclassify\\na photo of a cat, machine learning is now able to\\ncreate\\nan image or text description of a cat on demand.\\nLooking for direct answers to other complex questions?\\nExplore the full McKinsey Explainers series\\nHow do text-based machine learning models work? How are they trained?\\nChatGPT may be getting all the headlines now, but it‚Äôs not the first text-based machine learning model to make a splash. OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 and Google‚Äôs BERT both launched in recent years to some fanfare.\\nBut before ChatGPT, which by most accounts works pretty well most of the time (though it‚Äôs still being evaluated), AI chatbots didn‚Äôt always get the best reviews. GPT-3 is ‚Äúby turns super impressive and super disappointing,‚Äù said\\nNew York Times\\ntech reporter Cade Metz in a video where he and food writer Priya Krishna asked GPT-3 to write recipes for a\\n(rather disastrous) Thanksgiving dinner\\n.\\nThe first machine learning models to work with text were trained by humans to classify various inputs according to labels set by researchers. One example would be a model trained to label\\nsocial media\\nposts as either positive or negative. This type of training is known as supervised learning because a human is in charge of ‚Äúteaching‚Äù the model what to do.\\nThe next generation of text-based machine learning models rely on what‚Äôs known as self-supervised learning. This type of training involves feeding a model a massive amount of text so it becomes able to generate predictions. For example, some models can predict, based on a few words, how a sentence will end. With the right amount of sample text‚Äîsay, a broad swath of the internet‚Äîthese text models become quite accurate. We‚Äôre seeing just how accurate with the success of tools like ChatGPT.\\nWhat does it take to build a generative AI model?\\nBuilding a generative AI model has for the most part been a major undertaking, to the extent that\\nonly a few well-resourced tech heavyweights have made an attempt\\n. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, former GPT models, and DALL-E, has billions in funding from bold-face-name donors. DeepMind is a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and even Meta has dipped a toe into the generative AI model pool with its Make-A-Video product. These companies employ some of the world‚Äôs best computer scientists and engineers.\\nBut it‚Äôs not just talent. When you‚Äôre asking a model to train using nearly the entire internet, it‚Äôs going to cost you. OpenAI hasn‚Äôt released exact costs, but estimates indicate that GPT-3 was trained on around\\n45 terabytes\\nof text data‚Äîthat‚Äôs about one million feet of bookshelf space, or a quarter of the entire Library of Congress‚Äîat an estimated cost of several million dollars. These aren‚Äôt resources your garden-variety start-up can access.\\nWhat kinds of output can a generative AI model produce?\\nAs you may have noticed above, outputs from generative AI models can be indistinguishable from human-generated content, or they can seem a little uncanny. The results depend on the quality of the model‚Äîas we‚Äôve seen, ChatGPT‚Äôs outputs so far appear superior to those of its predecessors‚Äîand the match between the model and the use case, or input.\\nChatGPT can produce what one commentator called a ‚Äú\\nsolid A-\\n‚Äù essay comparing theories of nationalism from Benedict Anderson and Ernest Gellner‚Äîin ten seconds. It also produced an already famous passage describing how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR in the style of the King James Bible. Image-generating AI models like DALL-E 2 can create strange, beautiful images on demand, like a\\nRaphael painting of a Madonna and child, eating pizza\\n. Other generative AI models can produce code, video, audio, or\\nbusiness simulations\\n.\\nBut the outputs aren‚Äôt always accurate‚Äîor appropriate. When Priya Krishna asked DALL-E 2 to come up with an image for Thanksgiving dinner, it produced a scene where the turkey was garnished with whole limes, set next to a bowl of what appeared to be guacamole. For its part, ChatGPT seems to have trouble counting, or solving basic algebra problems‚Äîor, indeed, overcoming the sexist and racist bias that lurks in the undercurrents of the internet and society more broadly.\\nGenerative AI outputs are carefully calibrated combinations of the data used to train the algorithms. Because the amount of data used to train these algorithms is so incredibly massive‚Äîas noted, GPT-3 was trained on 45 terabytes of text data‚Äîthe models can appear to be ‚Äúcreative‚Äù when producing outputs. What‚Äôs more, the models usually have random elements, which means they can produce a variety of outputs from one input request‚Äîmaking them seem even more lifelike.\\nWhat kinds of problems can a generative AI model solve?\\nThe\\nopportunity for businesses\\nis clear. Generative AI tools can produce a wide variety of credible writing in seconds, then respond to criticism to make the writing more fit for purpose. This has implications for a wide variety of industries, from IT and software organizations that can benefit from the instantaneous, largely correct code generated by AI models to organizations in need of marketing copy. In short, any organization that needs to produce clear written materials potentially stands to benefit. Organizations can also use generative AI to create more technical materials, such as higher-resolution versions of medical images. And with the time and resources saved here, organizations can pursue new business opportunities and the chance to create more value.\\nWe‚Äôve seen that developing a generative AI model is so resource intensive that it is out of the question for all but the biggest and best-resourced companies. Companies looking to put generative AI to work have the option to either use generative AI out of the box or fine-tune them to perform a specific task. If you need to prepare slides according to a specific style, for example, you could ask the model to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù how headlines are normally written based on the data in the slides, then feed it slide data and ask it to write appropriate headlines.\\nWhat are the limitations of AI models? How can these potentially be overcome?\\nBecause they are so new, we have yet to see the long tail effect of generative AI models. This means there are\\nsome inherent risks\\ninvolved in using them‚Äîsome known and some unknown.\\nThe outputs generative AI models produce may often sound extremely convincing. This is by design. But sometimes the information they generate is just plain wrong. Worse, sometimes it‚Äôs biased (because it‚Äôs built on the gender, racial, and myriad other biases of the internet and society more generally) and can be manipulated to enable unethical or criminal activity. For example, ChatGPT won‚Äôt give you instructions on how to hotwire a car, but if you say you need to hotwire a car to save a baby, the algorithm is happy to comply. Organizations that rely on generative AI models should reckon with reputational and legal risks involved in unintentionally publishing biased, offensive, or copyrighted content.\\nThese risks can be mitigated, however, in a few ways. For one, it‚Äôs crucial to carefully select the initial data used to train these models to avoid including toxic or biased content. Next, rather than employing an off-the-shelf generative AI model, organizations could consider using smaller, specialized models. Organizations with more resources could also customize a general model based on their own data to fit their needs and minimize biases. Organizations should also keep a human in the loop (that is, to make sure a real human checks the output of a generative AI model before it is published or used) and avoid using generative AI models for critical decisions, such as those involving significant resources or human welfare.\\nIt can‚Äôt be emphasized enough that this is a new field. The\\nlandscape of risks and opportunities\\nis likely to change rapidly in coming weeks, months, and years. New use cases are being tested monthly, and new models are likely to be developed in the coming years. As generative AI becomes increasingly, and seamlessly, incorporated into business, society, and our personal lives, we can also expect a\\nnew regulatory climate\\nto take shape. As organizations begin experimenting‚Äîand creating value‚Äîwith these tools, leaders will do well to keep a finger on the pulse of regulation and risk.\\nPop quiz\\nArticles referenced include:\\n\"\\nImplementing generative AI with speed and safety\\n,‚Äù March 13, 2024, Oliver Bevan, Michael Chui,\\nIda Kristensen\\n, Brittany Presten, and\\nLareina Yee\\n‚Äú\\nBeyond the hype: Capturing the potential of AI and gen AI in tech, media, and telecom\\n,‚Äù February 22, 2024,\\nVenkat Atluri\\n,\\nPeter Dahlstr√∂m\\n,\\nBrendan Gaffey\\n, V√≠ctor Garc√≠a de la Torre,\\nNoshir Kaka\\n,\\nTom√°s Lajous\\n,\\nAlex Singla\\n,\\nAlex Sukharevsky\\n,\\nAndrea Travasoni\\n, and\\nBenjamim Vieira\\n‚Äú\\nAs gen AI advances, regulators‚Äîand risk functions‚Äîrush to keep pace\\n,‚Äù December 21, 2023, Andreas Kremer, Angela Luget,\\nDaniel Mikkelsen\\n,\\nHenning Soller\\n, Malin Strandell-Jansson, and Sheila Zingg\\n‚Äú\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n,‚Äù June 14, 2023, Michael Chui,\\nEric Hazan\\n,\\nRoger Roberts\\n,\\nAlex Singla\\n,\\nKate Smaje\\n,\\nAlex Sukharevsky\\n,\\nLareina Yee\\n, and\\nRodney Zemmel\\n‚Äú\\nWhat every CEO should know about generative AI\\n,‚Äù May 12, 2023, Michael Chui,\\nRoger Roberts\\n, Tanya Rodchenko,\\nAlex Singla\\n,\\nAlex Sukharevsky\\n,\\nLareina Yee\\n, and\\nDelphine Zurkiya\\n‚Äú\\nExploring opportunities in the generative AI value chain\\n,‚Äù April 26, 2023, Tobias H√§rlin,\\nGardar Bj√∂rnsson Rova\\n,\\nAlex Singla\\n, Oleg Sokolov, and\\nAlex Sukharevsky\\n‚Äú\\nThe state of AI in 2022‚Äîand a half decade in review\\n,‚Äù December 6, 2022,\\xa0Michael Chui,\\nBryce Hall\\n,\\nHelen Mayhew\\n,\\nAlex Singla\\n, and\\nAlex Sukharevsky\\n‚Äú\\nMcKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2023\\n,‚Äù July 20, 2023,\\xa0Michael Chui, Mena Issler,\\nRoger Roberts\\n, and\\nLareina Yee\\n‚Äú\\nAn executive‚Äôs guide to AI\\n,‚Äù Michael Chui, Vishnu Kamalnath, and Brian McCarthy\\n‚Äú\\nWhat AI can and can‚Äôt do (yet) for your business\\n,‚Äù January 11, 2018,\\xa0Michael Chui,\\nJames Manyika\\n, and Mehdi Miremadi\\nThis article was updated in April 2024; it was originally published in January 2023.\\nWant to know more about generative AI?\\nTalk to us\\nRelated Articles\\nArticle\\nThe data dividend: Fueling generative AI\\nPodcast\\nDon‚Äôt wait‚Äîcreate, with generative AI'}]"
